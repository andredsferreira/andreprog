# IP (IPv4)

It's main purpose is to deliver packets between hosts on different networks, through the Internet.

**Universally addressed** : It assigns an universally unique IP address to the hosts. Necessary for delivery across the Internet.

**Conectionless** : It doesn't establish a connection between hosts before sending.

**Best-effort** : It doesn't guarantee the delivery of packets, only tries to send. It also doesn't provide error detection for the data it sends, only the headers.

**Unacknowledged** : Senders don't know if the packet arrived at the destination. They don't get acknowledgement.
