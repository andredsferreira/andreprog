## Types of networks

*Circuit switching* : A single dedicated physical path (called a circuit) for transmiting data is established between the devices. While the connection persists the transmiting of data always uses this path.

*Packet switching* : The data is broken down into small chunks, called packets, for transmiting. The path between the devices is variable and the packets may arrive out of order and with errors.

## Types of protocols

*Connection-oriented protocols* : A logical connection between devices is required before transmiting data. They guarantee that the data arrives at the destination. After the transmiting is over the connection is broken (eg., the TCP protocol is connection-oriented).

*Connectionless protocols* : Don’t require a connection between devices, if a device has data to send it just sends it. Don’t guarantee that the data arrives at the destination (eg., the UDP protocol is connectionless).  

*Protocol Data Unit (PDU)* : A particular protocol message associated with a layer of the OSI.

*Service Data Unit (SDU)* : The payload of a certain PDU. The payload is usually the full PDU of the layer above it (eg. an IP packet SDU is a the full TCP PDU).

## Network structural models

*Peer-to-peer networking* : Each device in the network is treated equally (has no specific role), can both serve and collect resources.

*Client-server networking* :  A client asks a server for resources. The server provides centralized resource serving to many clients. This is the networking structural model used in the Internet.
The internet is a complex network of networks that includes several ISP’s that allow for the global Internet access we have today. Depending on their reach (the reach of their network) ISP’s can be categorized into different tiers. The following are important concepts to understand the Internet’s network.

## Internet : a network of networks

*ISP (Internet Service Provider)* : Provides internet access to end users through mediums like DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), cable modem, and optic-fiber. ISP’s are themselves networks that are interconnected, they are categorized within tiers depending on their reach (regional, national, global).

*Tier 1 ISP* : An ISP with (almost) global reach. It interconnects lower tier ISP’s and peers with other global ISP’s. Global ISP providers include AT&T (USA), Lumen Technologies (USA), NTT Communications (Japan).

*Regional ISP* : Provides regional internet access, it communicates with tier 1 ISP’s, between regional ISP’s, and to access ISP’s.

*Access ISP* :  The ISP on the lowest tier in the Internet, it directly provides the access to end users.

*Point of presence (PoP)* : Simply a group of network devices of a particular ISP where customer ISP’s can connect to (inside a dedicated building). They are only present in  Tier 1 ISP’s and regional ISP’s: since these act as providers for lower tier ISP’s.

*Internet exchange point (IXP)* : A location where multiple different ISP’s can peer with each other. IXP’s are usually provided by third party companies.
