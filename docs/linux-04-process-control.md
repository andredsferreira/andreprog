### Killing processes

```bash
# List all avaialble signals

kill -l

# Kill a process specifying the signal
# kill [-signal] [pid]

kill -SIGINT 9887
kill -9 452 # Sends KILL signal 

# Kill by specfiyng process name or other attribute

# pkill [-signal] process_name
# pkill -u user user_processes
# pkill [process_name]
# pkill -u [process_user]

pkill httpd

# Sends SIGTERM to all processes owned by andre
pkill -u andre 

# Kills firefox processes owned by andre
pkill -u andre firefox 
```
### Process monitoring with ps

```bash
# Common flags used in the ps:
# a: show processes for all users
# u: display user oriented format
# x: include processes not attached to the terminal (eg. daemons, GUI apps)

ps aux

# Frequent pattern to identify a PID

ps aux | grep sshd
pgrep sshd
```

### Niceness value

Represent how "nice" a process is to others in the system. If a process as a high niceness value it means it has low priority. If it has low niceness it means it has high priority.

Values range: [-20, 19]

```bash
# Starting a process with a specified niceness level

# Example setting a nice value to 7
nice -n 7 path/to/process/executable

# Renicing a process
renice -15 pid
# Renicing all specific user processes
renice 10 -u andre
```
### The /proc pseudo-filesystem

The /proc is a pseudo-filesystem created by the kernel and is populated once viewed directly (ls may display wrong data).
It contains detailed informations about processes when ps or top might not be enough.
